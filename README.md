Machine Names
======

This exercise was given to me by manager as an intro to Ruby on Rails.  

Goals:
   * Familarize myself with looping and the use of variables.
   * Reduce the 127 lines of code down as much as possible.  

My manager reduced it down to 66 lines.  I reduced it down to 27 lines!

This program has two versions that yields the same results. 

names-long.rb => prints out all machines names one line at a time.
names-short.rb => is a condensed version using looping and variables to print out same results
